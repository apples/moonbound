Ludum Dare 49 - Unstable

Action RPG where your stats and enemy stats are determined by an active crypto market.
Top down basic combat with enemies.
Enemies are each tied to one stat market which determines all of their stats.
Enemies drop more USD when killed when the market is high.
"Selling" a crypto lowers that market by a bit.
Possible "stall" or "jam" action to temporarily freeze the markets.
